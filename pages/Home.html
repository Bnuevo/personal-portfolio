        <p>Nice to meet you! Obviously I am Brian Nuevo. I am an experienced Software Engineer with an emphasis in Data and Machine Learning. My love for data began thanks to the adoption of the per36min statistic in the NBA.
            From then on I have become obsessed with "If you challenge conventional wisdom, you will find ways to do things much better than they are currently done". Born and Raised in Sacramento, CA. I am a norcal Native who attended the University of Nevada, Reno
            and graduated with a B.S. in Information Systems and a minor in Business Analytics. A true weekend warrior on the slopes, links or the local crag if I am not stuck in VS code.
